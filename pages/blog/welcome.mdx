# Hello world

Hey! Welcome to my blog. As this is the first post, I feel it is important to declare a structure as to what this platform will be.

## Why

I am aware that few people will read this, however, fame is the opposite of _why_ this page exists. It's important for people to have a creative outlet, and to scream into the void that is the internet.

## What

This page is going to be dedicated to modern, upcoming technologies, as well as software architecture patterns, design practices, and to put it simply, coding stuff.

export default ({ children }) => <Blog>{children}</Blog>
