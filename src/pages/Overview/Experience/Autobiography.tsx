        My name is Cooper Runyan, I was born on September 27, 2006, in San Diego, California, making me {new Date().getFullYear() - 2006} years old today. I
        started coding when I was 13, in a language called Javascript. You probably have, at the very least, heard of this language, as it is debatably the most
        popular coding language today. Javascript is an amazing language, and I'm glad my dad encouraged me to learn it.
